## 🔍 Overview

**AutoMile** is a **Neural Network-powered chatbot** developed to assist users with vehicle maintenance and repair-related queries. Built as part of my final year research project titled:

> **"IoT-Driven Vehicle Lifecycle Optimization and Maintenance"**

The chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a trained deep learning model to provide accurate and real-time automotive advice based on user input.
